AutosportLabs F4 Bootloader Library
===================================

Introduction
------------

This is a small python script (via setuptools entry\_point) and library
for the updating of CortexM4 microcontrollers. Currently, only the
STM32F407 is supported, though more microcontrollers are planned for the
future (Namely, Infineon XMC4000 series).

Installation
------------

You can either install via pip: pip install asl\_f4\_loader OR build
from scratch.

Building from scratch will require the gcc-arm-embedded toolchain, as
much of the library is autogenerated by the firmware build system.

Building
--------

Clone the ASL\_F4\_bootloader git repository:
https://github.com/autosportlabs/ASL\_F4\_bootloade

CD into the top directory.

type: 'make'

This will produce both a bootloader image, as well as a python package
that can be installed via pip
